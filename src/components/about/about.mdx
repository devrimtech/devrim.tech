# Who

I am a high school student in the Bay Area who loves all things about computers. When I am not on my computer (rarely) I am hanging out with my dog Mocha, [or playing games,](https://steamcommunity.com/id/kaidevrim) [or watching anime,](https://kitsu.io/KaiDevrim) or going to class, [or taking photos](https://photos.dvr.im).
I also am an active member in one of the largest programming communities,[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) and even wrote [a workshop](https://workshops.hackclub.com/minecraft_modding).
Other than that, I love volunteering for various programming communities and am currently helping out with [CodeDay Bay Area] (https://codeday.org/ba). Personally, I love to work on my [Homelab](https://dash.dvr.im) and learn new technologies. Currently I am studying for my CompTIA A+ certification while also making a [few programming projects](https://devrim.tech/#projects/) along the way.
Overall, I just love making the world a better place and having fun while doing so.
