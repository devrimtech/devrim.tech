# Building My Long-Term Server Setup

## Motivation

About three years ago, I decided to go all-in on building a server that would last me for several years—ideally through the rest of college. I didn't want to constantly swap hardware or rebuild every few months. Instead, my goal was a stable, future-proof setup that could handle storage, virtualization, and media needs without constant tinkering.

I had a few requirements in mind when designing this server.

## The Wants

**1. Reliable Storage**
I wanted at least 20 TB of storage in a RAID-1 array. RAID-1 mirrors data, allowing a drive to fail without losing anything while making replacement simple. This meant at least three 10 TB hard drives—ideally four, with one dedicated to redundancy.

**2. Real-Time Media Transcoding**
The server needed to handle real-time media transcoding. This meant either a dedicated GPU or a powerful Intel CPU with integrated graphics. Transcoding lets me adjust the bitrate of streamed media on the fly and also enables tools like [Tdarr](https://home.tdarr.io/), which can automatically re-encode media into efficient formats like H.265 or AV1, saving storage without noticeable quality loss.

**3. Virtualization Compatibility**
Since I wanted to run **TrueNAS, Proxmox, and Docker**, strong virtualization performance was a must. I already had experience with these tools, so the hardware needed to support them reliably.

## The Upgrade

At the time, I was working at McDonald's to fund this project. Luckily, I came across great hard drive deals from [Rhino Technology Group on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/str/rhinotechnologygroup). They consistently had 10 TB SAS drives for under $100—around **$9 per TB**, which was an incredible deal. Over the next few years, I collected six or seven of these drives. Impressively, they lasted about three years before I needed replacements in 2025 which was much better than I expected.

Unfortunately, SAS drives aren't the same as SATA, so I needed a PCIe to SAS adapter card. This adapter card took up my only PCIe slot. Since my motherboard only had one PCIe slot, this meant I couldn't add a dedicated GPU. Fortunately, my old HTC Vive PC build came in clutch, it had an **Intel i5-11600K**, a fast CPU with an integrated GPU that supports AV1 transcoding. This covered both computing and media needs without requiring a discrete GPU.

I also saved up enough for **32 GB of RAM**. In storage setups, a common recommendation I got was to have at least 1 GB of RAM for every TB of storage. While 24 GB would have worked, I went with 2 x 16 GB sticks to enable dual-channel mode, which is faster than using mismatched sticks.

## Final Hardware Setup

- **CPU**: Intel Core i5-11600K (11th Gen, 6 cores @ 3.9GHz)
- **SSD**: PNY CS900 512 GB (boot drive)
- **Motherboard**: ASRock H510M-HVS
- **RAM**: 2 × 16 GB Crucial DDR4 (2667 MT/s)
- **Storage**: 4 × 10 TB SAS hard drives (RAID-1 array)

## Software Setup

On the software side, I went with a familiar stack: **Proxmox, TrueNAS, and Docker**.

- **Proxmox**: My Type-1 hypervisor, managing VMs and hardware resources. It's reliable, user-friendly, and great for virtualization.
- **TrueNAS Scale**: Installed in a dedicated VM with direct SAS controller passthrough. It handles all storage management, with access from Proxmox and other services via NFS mounts.
- **LXC + Docker**: I run Docker in an LXC container, which hosts all my internal/external services. Reverse proxy and SSL are handled by **Traefik**, even on LAN services with custom domains.

Here's my current Docker lineup:

- **Core/Networking**: Traefik (reverse proxy), Cloudflared (tunnel/forwarding)
- **Media**: Radarr, Sonarr, Prowlarr, Overseerr, qBittorrent, Deluge, Tautulli
- **Utilities**: Filestash, LibreSpeed, Flame (dashboard), Memos, Dillinger (Markdown editor), Shiori (bookmarks), Whoogle (search engine), Redlib (Reddit proxy), FlareSolverr
- **Specialized**: Polr (URL shortener), Ubooquity (eBooks)

To simplify management, I run all of these in a single **docker-compose.yml**. This makes redeployment easy if the server goes down, restoring everything is just one compose command away.

For automation, I use **GitHub Actions, Ansible, and Terraform**:
- Pushing a commit to my repo triggers GitHub Actions, which SSHs into the server, pulls updates, and redeploys containers automatically.
- Terraform provisions new LXC containers in Proxmox, while Ansible configures them immediately afterward—so I almost never need to log in manually.

## The Future

As of now, the server runs flawlessly. No bottlenecks, just enough storage, and plays nicely together. This setup is essentially my dream homelab, but there's still one big stretch goal that I dream about, running it as a **cloud gaming server** (like private xCloud). That would require a much beefier GPU, more power, and higher cost—so for now, it stays a dream.
