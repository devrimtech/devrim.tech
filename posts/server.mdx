## Raspberry Pi Adventures

Just like everyone else nowadays, I also started with a nifty little [Single-Board Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer) known as the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). I got it from my local Fry's (now gone) in 2016 and immediately started loading up the Raspberry PiOS on it. The first few uses I had for it were of course emulating different retro consoles like the GameBoy and SNES using [RetroPie](retropie.org.uk). I then set out to make a portable retro gaming console filled to the brim with old games that I would probably never play. I decided to make a wristwatch device that connected to an e-ink display and I could play the games using a DualShock 4 Controller (PS4). The Pi was charged using a battery pack that I stored in my pocket. I kept this project around like all my other Pi projects, which was for about a week. <img src="/rpi.jpeg" alt="My Finished Built" width="500" height="400" />

### What about the Server?

After building the watch I then needed to find another project to use my Pi for. I just so happened to find this awesome tool called [PiHole](https://pihole.org) out and became fascinated with using my Pi as my ultimate network device. I then started installing PiHole which was a simple DNS server that would block ads. Along with PiHole I also experimented with turning the Pi into a Router, a VPN Server, and a WiFI Hotspot. I don't think I got particularly success into doing all of that as a lot of it was outside my range of knowledge at the time but it did introduce me to many of the concepts that I would use for running servers to this day. <img src="/pihole.png" alt="PiHole Web GUI" width="640" height="480" />

## The Mac Mini Catalyst

Around this time I wanted to get into hosting gaming servers and running a NAS (Network Attached Storage). I had a spare Mac Mini lying around so I remembered that my school had a closet of Mac Mini servers so I started to use it. I plugged it in and started installing the Mac Server tool and played around with it. After that I started trying to install a Minecraft Server on it and was met with the catalyst that made me build my own server. The Mac Mini had only 4GB of RAM which was not enough to run a Minecraft Server.

## Building My Own

Although I had many other options to use the Mac Mini for I ultimately decided to go on [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) and start building my own. Since I did not know much about servers at the time I built a desktop computer with a big case. In hindsight this was not a good idea but for a 13 year old kid who had never built a computer or even knew server hardware. I settled on the following build:

- CPU: [AMD A8-9600 Radeon (4 Cores, 3.1Ghz)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078HNG7VD)
- MotherBoard: [MSI ProSeries AMD A320](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0822M7BS5)
- PSU: [Corsair VS450 450 Watts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078HNG7VD)
- RAM: [Crucial 16GB Single DDR4 2666](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0734V1YVL)
- SSD: 512GB M.2 SSD (Not too sure which)
- Case: [DEEPCOOL MATREXX 30 Mini-ITX](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QZDM8K4)
- OS: [Ubuntu Server 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/server)

## Finding the Perfect OS

I started with Ubuntu Server because Ubuntu was the biggest name in the Linux world and I had experience with using Pop!\_OS and liked the apt package manager. I stuck with Ubuntu Server until my networking on it broke for some reason and none of my friends could figure out why. I then switched to Debian and started learning Docker on it. There was a lot of fun stuff I could deploy using Docker like a [Minecraft Server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) or like all the fun stuff that [LinuxServer.io](https://linuxserver.io) had. There were so many possibilities I had with Docker and I was learning like crazy. That is not to say there were not a lot of problems I faced, like I did not understand Nginx at all and constantly ran into errors when using the [Swag container](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag) which was a simplified setup of Nginx. There was a lot to learn and a lot my setup could improve on. Throughout the months I reinstalled Debian but one day I had a friend suggest to me that I should use this OS called [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/). I went to install it and it really is one of the best tools I ever learned to use.

## What is Proxmox

Proxmox in technical terms is just a type 1 hypervisor with a remote Web GUI built upon Debian. In layman terms it means that it could run Virtual Machines or multiple Operating Systems under it.
