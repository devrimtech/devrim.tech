## Raspberry Pi Adventures

Just like everyone else nowadays, I also started with a nifty little [Single-Board Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer) known as the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). I got it from my local Fry's (now gone) in 2016 and immediately started loading up the Raspberry PiOS on it. The first few uses I had for it were of course emulating different retro consoles like the GameBoy and SNES using [RetroPie](retropie.org.uk). I then set out to make a portable retro gaming console filled to the brim with old games that I would probably never play. I decided to make a wristwatch device that connected to an e-ink display and I could play the games using a DualShock 4 Controller (PS4). The Pi was charged using a battery pack that I stored in my pocket. I kept this project around like all my other Pi projects, which was for about a week. ![My Finished Build](/rpi.jpeg)

### What about the Server?

After building the watch I then needed to find another project to use my Pi for. I just so happened to find this awesome tool called [PiHole](https://pihole.org) out and became fascinated with using my Pi as my ultimate network device. I then started installing PiHole which was a simple DNS server that would block ads. Along with PiHole I also experimented with turning the Pi into a Router, a VPN Server, and a WiFI Hotspot. I don't think I got particularly success into doing all of that as a lot of it was outside my range of knowledge at the time but it did introduce me to many of the concepts that I would use for running servers to this day. ![PiHole Web GUI](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/59c9a191810a880f2697045c794ebfdd26be84bd7c28f5ae04d5297155bff107/68747470733a2f2f70692d686f6c652e6769746875622e696f2f67726170686963732f53637265656e73686f74732f7069686f6c652d64617368626f6172642e706e67)

## The Mac Mini Catalyst

Around this time I wanted to get into hosting gaming servers and running a NAS (Network Attached Server)
