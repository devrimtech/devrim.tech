## Raspberry Pi Adventures

Just like everyone else nowadays, I also started with a nifty little [Single-Board Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer) known as the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). I got it from my local Fry's (now gone) in 2016 and immediately started loading up the Raspberry PiOS on it. The first few uses I had for it were of course emulating different retro consoles like the GameBoy and SNES using [RetroPie](retropie.org.uk).
